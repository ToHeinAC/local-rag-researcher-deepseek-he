Operators subject to this obligation must declare storage to the competent authority and secure residues against loss and unauthorized access [1]. The competent authority may require compliance with monitoring limits for non-monitored residues [1]. Cross-border transportation of residues for disposal is prohibited [1]. Operators must declare intended recovery or disposal of monitored residues to the competent authority and may be released from monitoring for specific recoveries or disposals under certain conditions (strlschg\\_en\\_bf.pdf:0:103). Conditions include ensuring public protection against exposure, maintaining occupational worker body doses below categorical levels, and no reservations on the method of recovery or disposal [2].\n",

       "Under the Federal Immission Control Act (BImSchG), companies are required to comply with statutory ordinances on monitoring limits and methods of recovery and disposal for residues, issued by the federal government with the consent of the Bundesrat. These residues must not be mixed or diluted prior to their intended disposal or recovery. The party under an obligation in accordance with section 61 subsection 1 is responsible for securing residues against loss and access by unauthorised parties prior to their disposal or recovery. Cross-border transportation of residues into Germany for their disposal is prohibited.\n",
       "        The first sentence of section 61 applies not only to residues accumulated in Germany, but also to those brought into Germany from abroad for recovery. If the party under an obligation in accordance with section 61 subsection 1 has established that the residues require monitoring, they must declare their intended recovery or disposal without undue delay to the competent authority, stating their nature, mass and specific activity. A declaration may be dispensed with if notification is made in accordance with section 63 subsection 1 due to the nature and specific activity of the residues requiring monitoring.\n",
       "        At the request of the party under an obligation in accordance with section 61 subsection 1, first sentence, the competent authority shall release residues requiring monitoring from that monitoring for a particular recovery or disposal, provided that 1. the requisite protection of the population against exposure is ensured by means of the measures put in place for recovery or disposal, 2. the body dose of occupational workers in the course of disposal or recovery cannot exceed the levels for categorisation as an occupationally-exposed person, and 3. there are no reservations under the law on waste as to the permissibility of the envisaged method of recovery or disposal and whether it will be complied with. Release from the monitoring obligation is effected by means of notice in writing.\n",
       "        The criteria for protecting the public are that, as a constraint for the exposure of members of the public caused by disposal or recovery, even without additional measures an effective dose of 1 mSv in a given calendar week must not be exceeded."
