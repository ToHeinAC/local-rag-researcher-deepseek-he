       "Similarly for page 103.\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking at the first document's content (page 102), it covers points like federal government's power, mixing prohibition, storage declarations, cross-border transport ban.\n",
       "\n",
       "The second document (page 103) has section 62 details about declarations to authorities, release conditions with criteria including 1 mSv dose limit.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now structuring the summary:\n",
       "\n",
       "Start with the main regulations: compliance with methods via ordinance [cite 102]. Then mention mixing/dilution prohibition and storage requirements from same page. Note cross-border transport ban also in 102. Then move to section 62's declaration requirement (page 103), release conditions, including public exposure limit of 1 mSv (from 103).\n",
       "\n",
       "Make sure each sentence cites the correct part. For example:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The federal government can establish monitoring limits and methods for residue disposal through statutory ordinances with Bundesrat consent [strlschg_en_bf.pdf](strlschg_en_bf.pdf:0:102). Residues must not be mixed or diluted before disposal, and storage declarations are mandatory; cross-border transportation into Germany is prohibited [same citation]. Parties must declare recovery/disposal plans unless exempted, while authorities can release residues from monitoring if public exposure stays under 1 mSv and worker doses comply with occupational standards [strlschg_en_bf.pdf](strlschg_en_bf.pdf:0:103).\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, but the storage declarations are in first doc (page 102), so need to cite that. The cross-border is also there. Then the declaration requirements and release criteria from page 103.\n",
       "\n",
       "So splitting into sentences:\n",
       "\n",
       "First sentence covers federal power and methods. Second about mixing/dilution, storage rules, and transport ban (all from 102). Third sentence on declarations and releases under section 62 with specific criteria from 103.\n",
       "\n",
       "Need to check if all key points are included: monitoring limits by ordinance, no mixing before disposal, storage declaration requirements, cross-border prohibition. Then in section 62: declare intent, release conditions including public dose limit (1 mSv), worker exposure below occupational thresholds, and compliance with waste law.\n",
       "\n",
       "So the summary should mention:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Federal authority to set rules via ordinance [cite 102]\n",
       "- Mixing/dilution prohibited; storage declarations required; cross-border transport banned [all from 102]\n",
       "- Parties must declare unless under section63 notification [from 103]\n",
       "- Authorities can release residues if public dose <1 mSv and worker limits met, plus waste law compliance [103]\n",
       "\n",
       "Now assembling into concise sentences with proper citations:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The federal government establishes monitoring limits and disposal methods for residues through statutory ordinances approved by the Bundesrat [strlschg_en_bf.pdf](strlschg_en_bf.pdf:0:102). Residues must not be mixed or diluted prior to disposal, and their storage requires mandatory declarations; cross-border transportation into Germany is prohibited [strlschg_en_bf.pdf](strlschg_en_bf.pdf:0:102).
