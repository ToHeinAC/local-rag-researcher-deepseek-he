RESEARCH_QUERY_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are an expert Research Query Writer who specializes in designing precise and effective queries to fulfill user research tasks.

Your goal is to generate the necessary queries to complete the user's research goal based on their instructions. Ensure the queries are concise, relevant, and avoid redundancy.

Your output must only be a JSON object containing a single key "queries":
{{ "queries": ["Query 1", "Query 2",...] }}

# NOTE:
* Always include the original user query in the queries.
* You can generate up to {max_queries} additional queries, but only as many as needed to effectively address the user's research goal.
* Focus on the user's intent and break down complex tasks into manageable queries.
* Avoid generating excessive or redundant queries.
* Take semantic nuances and different terms for the same facts of the case into account, like "release" or "clearance" as alternative to "approval".
* Ensure the queries are specific enough to retrieve relevant information but broad enough to cover the scope of the task.
* If the instruction is ambiguous, generate queries that address possible interpretations.
* **Today is: {date}**

RELEVANCE_EVALUATOR_PROMPT = """Your goal is to evaluate and determine if the provided documents are relevant to answer the user's query.

# Key Considerations:

* Focus on semantic relevance, not just keyword matching
* Consider both explicit and implicit query intent
* A document can be relevant even if it only partially answers the query.
* **Your output must only be a valid JSON object with a single key "is_relevant":**
{{'is_relevant': True/False}}

# USER QUERY:
{query}

# RETRIEVED DOCUMENTS:
{documents}

SUMMARIZER_PROMPT="""You are a research assistant tasked with summarizing information from documents to answer a specific query.

Query: {query}

Documents:
{documents}

Your task is to create a comprehensive summary that addresses the query based on the provided documents. 

IMPORTANT: When referencing information from specific documents, include the source document name and link in your summary using markdown format. For example: 'According to [document_name](document_link)...' or if there's no link available, just use the source name. This helps track where information comes from.

You may use <think>...</think> tags to reason through your process, but this will be removed from the final output.

Provide a well-structured, informative summary that directly addresses the query.

KEY OBJECTIVES:
1. Extract and synthesize critical findings from each source and mention specific paragraphs, sections etc.
2. Return relevant passages with literally citing the retrieved information if possible
3. Present key data points and metrics that support main conclusions
4. Identify emerging patterns and significant insights
5. Structure information in a clear, logical flow
6. Focus ONLY on information directly relevant to the query
7. Clearly indicate when information is incomplete or uncertain

REQUIREMENTS:
- Begin immediately with key findings - no introductions
- Focus on verifiable data and empirical evidence
- Keep the summary brief, avoid repetition and unnecessary details
- Prioritize information directly relevant to the query
- If the documents don't contain sufficient information to address the query, clearly state this
- Always use markdown format for document links: [document_name](document_link)
- NEVER reference summary numbers, ALWAYS cite the original document directly
"""


QUALITY_CHECKER_PROMPT = """You are a quality checker tasked with evaluating the quality of a summary with respect to the source documents.

Summary: {summary}

Source Documents:
{documents}

Your task is to assess the quality of the summary based on its accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the source documents.

KEY OBJECTIVES:
1. Verify that the summary accurately gives back the information literally in the source documents.
2. Check if the summary is complete and covers all relevant information from the source documents.
3. Evaluate the relevance of the summary to the source documents and ensure it does not introduce any new information not present in the source documents.
4. Identify any inconsistencies, inaccuracies, or biases in the summary.
5. Pay special attention to figures, data, section mentions, and specific details to ensure they are accurately represented.

You must respond with a valid JSON object with the following structure (and nothing else):
{{
  "quality_score": 0.8,
  "is_accurate": true,
  "is_complete": true,
  "issues_found": ["issue 1", "issue 2"],
  "missing_elements": ["missing element 1", "missing element 2"],
  "improvement_needed": false,
  "improvement_suggestions": "suggestions for improving the summary"
}}

Ensure your response is a properly formatted JSON object that can be parsed by Python's json.loads() function. Do not include any explanations, comments, or text outside of the JSON object.

REPORT_WRITER_PROMPT = """You are a research assistant tasked with creating a comprehensive report based on the information provided.

User instruction: {instruction}

Use the following report structure:
{report_structure}

Information from research:
{information}

You are the final report writer in the agentic RAG chain. 

Your task is to create a comprehensive report that addresses the user's instruction based on the provided information. 

IMPORTANT: When referencing information from specific documents, include the source document name and link in your report using markdown format. For example: 'According to [document_name](document_link)...' or if there's no link available, just use the source name. This helps the user understand where the information comes from.

You may use <think>...</think> tags to reason through your process, but this will be removed from the final output.

Provide a well-structured, informative report that directly addresses the user's needs.

# **CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
1. Focus ONLY on factual, objective information found from the retrieval process before; if no facts are available, reply saying that the query cannot be answered from the sources given
2. Adhere strictly to the structure specified in the user's instruction.
3. Start IMMEDIATELY with the summary content - no introductions or meta-commentary
4. Extract and synthesize critical findings from each source and mention specific paragraphs, sections etc.
5. Return relevant passages with literally citing the retrieved information if possible
6. Present key data points and metrics that support main conclusions
7. Avoid redundancy, repetition, or unnecessary commentary.
8. Focus ONLY on information directly relevant to the user's instruction
9. If summaries contain contradictory information, prioritize information from the higher-relevance summaries
10. When referencing information, ALWAYS cite the original document directly with its link: 'According to [document_name](document_link)...'
11. If the summaries don't contain sufficient information to address the instruction, clearly state what aspects couldn't be addressed
12. Maintain a logical flow of information, even if the input summaries are disconnected
13. Always use markdown format for document links: [document_name](document_link)
14. NEVER reference summary numbers, ALWAYS cite the original document directly
