This is a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system. The main parts are the retrieval from local data, the summarization of the retrieved chunks and the generation of a final report.
Key critical requirements:
1. It is CRUCIAL for the summarization and the report writing that you use relevant passages with literally citing the retrieved data called information.
2. You MUST IN ANY CASE produce a final report based on the retrieved chunks and the subsequent summarization. In the REPORT_WRITER_PROMPT this is called information. No other information is to be used. In case the information is not relevant to the users query (e.g. the query is about a different topic than the documents for retrieval), you must state this explicitly.
3. ALWAYS CITE the original source document file names and full local paths including the file names through the full workflow using markdown format: [local_document_filename](.../file/local_document_file_name). That means that whenever an output is generated by invoking an LLM, this citation rule must be applied.
